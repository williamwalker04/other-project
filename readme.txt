/* This is an attempt to make my project more interactive and sleek using other bootstrap templates */

/* This project is an attempt to create a marketing website for an acquaintence's start-up catering Company.  He has given me certain parameters to work within, and certain data to include, but some of the information, including images, are simply placeholders until he has that information available for me.*/

/*In Smaller screens, It was intended for the grid of Images to become hidden and to show the Facebook Feed API.  However, there appears to be an issue with Facebooks current API, so at this time, It is not functioning correctly. */

/* I have used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Jquery, Json, and Bootstrap while creating this project.  Given the inclusion of a Bootstrap template, I cannot take all of the credit with regard to my sites "attractiveness". */
